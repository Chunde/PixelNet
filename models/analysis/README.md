## Analysis

We consider a single-scale 224x224 input image and used two different tasks (a). semantic segmentation on [PASCAL VOC-2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/index.html); and (b). surface normal estimation on [NYU-depth dataset](http://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html). The models used for Table-2 are contained in this folder. Note that we fine-tune the pretrained ImageNet model for this analysis, and we use hypercolumn features from conv-{1_2, 2_2, 3_3, 4_3, 5_3, 7} layers.
