# Demo

Here we give an example of testing a model for surface normal estimation. This code can be easily modified for other tasks. Note that this script is using a random surface normal model to demonstrate how to use the script.

Note: Please download the required data for the demo code using -

```make
wget http://learn.perception.cs.cmu.edu/GitHub/PixelNet/demo.tar.gz;
tar -xvzf demo.tar.gz;
